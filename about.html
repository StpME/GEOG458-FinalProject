            <span>Access to food is a fundamental need for every human being. However, there are areas and populations in the United States that have limited access to food, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This project aims to investigate the extent to which different minority groups are disproportionately affected by the issue of food access. By creating visualizations of food access conditions, we hope to raise public awareness and secure funding to help those in need across Washington state. As part of our Advanced Digital Geographies (GEOG 458) class, we designed a food access dashboard that shows users which regions and which vulnerable populations are most affected by this phenomenon.<span>

            <h1 class="text-center">Project Significance:</h1>
            <span>Food deserts can be defined as a region where it is difficult to buy affordable, good-quality fresh food every day. Poor people and other vulnerable populations like minorities or seniors are often the most impacted due to cost of living or the lack of access to a vehicle. Recognizing these inequalities and highlighting which regions in Washington state is an important step towards providing these populations with better access or support in combatting food deserts. </span>

        <div class="p-5 bg-brown mb-0" id="Methodology & Usage">
            <h1 class="text-center">Methodology:</h1>
            <span>
                <p>We implemented interactive maps through QGIS and Mapbox that illustrate disparities in food access and to emphasize the prominence of food deserts in low-income and marginalized communities across the country. The dashboard contains filters to show different populations to allow for comparison across regions within Washington.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The map displayed per filter represents the percent share of that population who have low/limited access to a quality supermarket for affordable, fresh food within 1/2 mile from where they live. Our side panel displays stats for the selected tract, showing total population, median income and poverty rate. It compares these tract values against the average Washington state values to allow for comparison.
