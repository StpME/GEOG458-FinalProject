            <h1 class="text-center">Project Idea</h1>
            <span>Access to food is a fundamental need for every human being. However, there are areas and populations in the United States that have limited access to food, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This project aims to investigate the extent to which different minority groups are disproportionately affected by the issue of food access. By creating visualizations of food access conditions, we hope to raise public awareness and secure funding to help those in need across Washington state. We will adopt Option one: Generic Digital Geographies project, designing a food access dashboard that shows users which regions and which populations are most affected by this phenomenon.<span>

            <h1 class="text-center">Project Significance/Broader Impacts:</h1>
            <span>Highlighting local food deserts allows people to recognize where they exist and whether or not they live in one, which is a powerful tool in creating social and communal action to push more affordable basic necessities. To help our audience understand the implications of our data and what a food desert even means, it is important to include basic definitions and resources in our site to help convey our message. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated food access issues, and the project's findings can inform policymakers and organizations working to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. The project's outcomes can also inform efforts to address food access issues in the long term.</span>

        <div class="p-4 bg-brown mb-0" id="Methodology">
            <h1 class="text-center">Functions:</h1>
            <span>We will implement interactive maps through QGIS and Mapbox that illustrate disparities in food access and to emphasize the prominence of food deserts in low-income and marginalized communities across the country. The dashboard will have filters to show different populations and counties to allow for comparison across regions within Washington. Selected categories will have a legend per layer to show which populations are being compared and to provide a clear picture of what is being focused on for the user.</span>

            <h1 class="text-center">Intended Audience:</h1>
            <span>This data can be used by experts and policymakers to make decisions on providing and increasing access to affordable, healthy foods for these populations affected, which tend to be low-income or minorities. It can also be used by organizations and the general population to better identify food deserts and recognize if any community or social action can be done to provide support. We will make stylistic choices that aim to emphasize and persuade our audience into taking actions and recognizing populations that have difficulties accessing affordable, high quality food in their area due to a variety of factors.</span>
